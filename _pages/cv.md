Research Experience
======
- **Text **

- **Humanoid Whole Body Control Through Text Command**

  Developed a whole body controller for humanoid robot through text command, based on teacher-student framework. Teacher policies are trained through RL to track the reference motions, and then distilled into a text conditioned student policy.

- **Learning for Safe Multiple Heterogeneous Quadcopter Control via Generalizable Barrier Certificate**

  Developed a method for training heterogeneous safe controller for quadcopters and generalizable barrier function simultaneously.

- **Geometry Variation Model Predictive Control For Bipedal Robot**

  Convex MPC based on geometry representation of system dynamics. Free of singularity and energy preserving.

- **State Estimation and Control of a Bipedal Robot**
  
  Proposed a novel slip detection and state estimation strategy, significantly improving the robot's robustness. Enable high-performance control with LQR based on whole-body dynamics. More details can be founed [HERE](https://kevin-shao-ustc.github.io/Bipedal.pdf)

- **SLAM and navigation of a Omnidirectional robot**
  
  Developed a 3D navigation system for a mobile robot, enhancing localization frequency and accuracy by integrating lidar, IMU, and encoder data with a Karman filter, and enabling the robot to navigate autonomously in uneven environments.
