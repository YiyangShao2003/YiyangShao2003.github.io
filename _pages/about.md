I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/).  I am currently visiting [UC Berkeley, Hybrid Robotics Group](https://hybrid-robotics.berkeley.edu/index.html), under the supervision of Prof. [Koushil Sreenath](https://hybrid-robotics.berkeley.edu/koushil/). Before that, I was supervised by Prof. [Shiwu Zhang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=d6tBg_UAAAAJ&hl=en-EN) at USTC. 
I am looking for a PhD position this application season!

Research Interests
======
My interest lies in **Control** and **Robot Learning**. I am currently focused on **Whole Body Control for Humanoids** and **Safe Interaction of Multi Agent Systems**. 

Research Experience
======

Humanoid Whole Body Control Via Text Command
------
Developed a whole body controller for humanoid robot through text command, based on teacher-student framework. Teacher policies are trained through RL to track the reference motions, and then distilled into a text conditioned student policy.

Learning for Safe Multiple Heterogeneous Quadcopter Control via Generalizable Barrier Certificate
------
Developed a method for training heterogeneous safe controller for quadcopters and generalizable barrier function simultaneously.

Geometry Variation Model Predictive Control For Bipedal Robot
------
Convex MPC based on geometry representation of system dynamics. Free of singularity and energy preserving.

State Estimation and Control of a Wheeled-Bipedal Robot
------
Proposed a novel slip detection and state estimation strategy, significantly improving the robot's robustness. Enable high-performance control with LQR based on whole-body dynamics. More details can be founed [HERE](https://kevin-shao-ustc.github.io/Bipedal.pdf)

SLAM and Navigation of a Omnidirectional Robot
------  
Developed a 3D navigation system for a mobile robot, enhancing localization frequency and accuracy by integrating lidar, IMU, and encoder data with a Karman filter, and enabling the robot to navigate autonomously in uneven environments. More details can be founed [HERE](https://kevin-shao-ustc.github.io/Sentry.pdf)
