I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/).  I am currently visiting [UC Berkeley, Hybrid Robotics Group](https://hybrid-robotics.berkeley.edu/index.html), under the supervision of Prof. [Koushil Screenath](https://hybrid-robotics.berkeley.edu/koushil/). Before that, I was supervised by Prof. [‪Shiwu Zhang‬‬](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=d6tBg_UAAAAJ&hl=en-EN) at USTC. 
Research Interests
======
My interest lies in **Control** and **Robot Learning**. I am currently focused on **Whole Body Control for Humanoids** and **Safe Interaction of Multi Agent Systems**. 
Research Experience
======
Humanoid Whole Body Control Through Text Command
------
  Developed a whole body controller for humanoid robot through text command, based on teacher-student framework. Teacher policies are trained through RL to track the reference motions, and then distilled into a text conditioned student policy.  <iframe width="612" height="360" src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15uLEWGOo-ETW9vFsupNedHy17-n59ryG/view?usp=drive_link" title="Geometry Variation MPC" frameorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
Learning for Safe Multiple Heterogeneous Quadcopter Control via Generalizable Barrier Certificate
------
  Developed a method for training heterogeneous safe controller for quadcopters and generalizable barrier function simultaneously.

Geometry Variation Model Predictive Control For Bipedal Robot
------
  Convex MPC based on geometry representation of system dynamics. Free of singularity and energy preserving.  <iframe width="612" height="360" src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jFZhjxslsXkZB1EHGqOv4WLjrwuWTKUU/view?usp=drive_link" title="Geometry Variation MPC" frameorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
State Estimation and Control of a Wheeled-Bipedal Robot
------
  Proposed a novel slip detection and state estimation strategy, significantly improving the robot's robustness. Enable high-performance control with LQR based on whole-body dynamics. More details can be founed [HERE](https://kevin-shao-ustc.github.io/Bipedal.pdf)

SLAM and Navigation of a Omnidirectional Robot
------  
Developed a 3D navigation system for a mobile robot, enhancing localization frequency and accuracy by integrating lidar, IMU, and encoder data with a Karman filter, and enabling the robot to navigate autonomously in uneven environments. More details can be founed [HERE](https://kevin-shao-ustc.github.io/Sentry.pdf)
