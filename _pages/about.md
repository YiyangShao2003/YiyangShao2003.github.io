I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) (USTC). Starting Fall 2025, I will be joining the [Hybrid Robotics Group](https://hybrid-robotics.berkeley.edu/index.html) at UC Berkeley as a Ph.D. student under the supervision of [Prof. Koushil Sreenath](https://hybrid-robotics.berkeley.edu/koushil/).

Research Interests
======
My interest lies in **Control** and **Robot Learning**. I am currently focused on bridging high-level intelligence with low-level controller in physical world. 

Research Experience
======

Language-directed Humanoid Whole Body Control via End-to-end Learning
------
- An end-to-end method enabling humanoid robots to interpret and execute diverse whole-body motions directly from natural language commands.

Learning for Safe Multiple Heterogeneous Quadcopter Control via Generalizable Barrier Certificate
------
- Developed a heterogeneous safe controller for quadcopters with generalizable barrier certificate.
- Simultaneously learn the control barrier function and constrained control policy.
- Online system identification from observation history for heterogeneous adaptation.

Geometry Variation Model Predictive Control For Bipedal Robot
------
- Geometry representation of system dynamic, invariant to coordinate system and free from singularity.
- Variation-based linearization of system dynamic to ensure the discretized system is energy-conserving.
- Enable stable walking of a bipedal robot.
Convex MPC based on geometry representation of system dynamics. Free of singularity and energy preserving.Â

State Estimation and Control of a Wheeled-Bipedal Robot
------
- Developed a robust state estimation and high-performance control algorithm for a wheeled-bipedal robot.
- Detect slipping based on the velocity difference of wheels' contact points with the ground in the inertial frame to adjust covariance in state estimation Kalman filter.
- Designed LQR controller based on whole-body dynamics.

SLAM and Navigation of an Omnidirectional Robot
------ 
- Develop a navigation system for a mobile robot to navigate through uneven terrain.
- Enhance localization frequency and accuracy by integrating lidar, IMU, and encoder data using a Kalman filter.
- Analyze terrain traversability through point cloud segmentation.
